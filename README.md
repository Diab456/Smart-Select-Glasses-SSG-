## SMART SELECT GLASSES (SSG)

*Many people don't have time to go to the glasses store; to buy glasses that fit their face, so some go to buy glasses from many sites such as Amazon or Souq and when *the customer receives the order, they find that the glasses don't match the customer's face at all. The customer must recover the product and this costs the customer *time and money as well as the service provider, so you decided to create a program to resolve this issue.


*I will create an application linked to a database that the service provider will display the merchandises thereon and also information about the merchandise and also *the place of the sale so customer creates an account on the App and complete some information like gender: male or female so AI creates 3 frame choices per person, *supported the customer’s face shape, gender, age, and also the foremost well-liked frames purchased by similar customers within the previous month.
